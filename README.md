# nkt-printer
This simple resource allows you to "use" printers to print document generated by players to enhance roleplay.

Players need to generate whatever they wanna print and upload it to an hosting image site, **DO NOT USE DISCORD** as it's links expires after a few days.

**Requirements**: Ox-inventory

this is integrates with esx but is not necessary, you can use whatever framework you want
```lua
--Add these items to your ox inventory items:
["doc"] = {
        label =  "Document",
        stack = false,
        consume = 0,
        client = {
            export = "nkt-printer.doc"
        }
    },
    ["paper"] = {
        label =  "Print paper",
        stack = true,
        consume = 0,
    }
```
